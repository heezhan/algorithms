// You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

var coinChange = function(coins, amount) {
    
};
// coins = [1,2,5] amount = 11
// If I want the fewest number of coins, then it makes sense for me to start with the coin with the biggest value.
// First I want to make sure that the biggest value doesn't exceed the amount
// If the biggest value doesn't exceed the amount, then I want to find the difference.
